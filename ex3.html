          <p>It is what the individual strives for in order to achieve.<br>
             The goal is the end of a process, the theoretical beginning 
             to achieve the desired goal. The goal is the directive of the<br>
             individual's behavior, which is what satisfies the motivation,
             to which the behavior is directed, and it is usually something<br>
             external. A goal is the crucial outcome that an individual seeks.
             The educational definition of the goal is the one that leads,<br>
             directs and guides the voluntary behavior for the purpose of
             reaching the endeavor and achieving it. Without that leadership,<br>
             and that guidance and direction for action and movement,
             the human action would have stumbled and chaotic, and the<br>
             behavior would not achieve a specific desired goal, and the
             activity and effort would not mean anything At that time the<br>
             activity and the lack thereof equal in value,</p>

                     you as well, and from here you will begin the process
